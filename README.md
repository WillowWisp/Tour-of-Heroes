# Tour of Heroes

The Tour of Heroes tutorial covers the fundamentals of Angular.

This basic app has many of the features you'd expect to find in a data-driven application. It acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.
